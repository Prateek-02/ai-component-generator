üíæ State Management & Persistence Strategy
Frontend (Next.js + React):
State Management: Local component state via useState and useEffect.

Real-time Preview: Updates inside a sandboxed <iframe> using srcDoc as the source.

Authentication: Managed via Supabase Auth, storing session in local storage for persistent login.

Auto-save: Debounced logic triggers every few seconds of inactivity, sending changes to the backend.

Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB):
CRUD API Endpoints: For creating, reading, updating, and deleting AI-generated components.

Auto-save API: Receives frequent updates and persists to MongoDB.

User-specific isolation: Each user's components are stored with user ID for scoped access.

‚öñÔ∏è Key Decisions & Trade-offs
‚úÖ Sandboxing Preview
Decision: Use an <iframe> with srcDoc for rendering generated code.

Pros: Isolated execution, avoids breaking the main app UI.

Cons: Cannot access React context or hooks inside the preview.

‚úÖ Auto-save Logic
Decision: Implement debounced auto-save after delay of inactivity (e.g., 2‚Äì3 seconds).

Pros: User experience is seamless; data isn't lost on refresh or accidental close.

Cons: Requires precise debounce tuning to balance performance and frequency.

‚úÖ Next.js for Frontend
Decision: Chosen for server-side rendering capabilities and rapid development with React.

Pros: Optimized performance, easy routing, SEO-friendly.

Cons: Requires handling of client/server lifecycle differences carefully.

‚úÖ MongoDB for Storage
Decision: Use MongoDB Atlas for storing user components and metadata.

Pros: Flexible document schema, scalable, cloud-hosted.

Cons: Needs careful indexing and structure to avoid performance bottlenecks at scale.
